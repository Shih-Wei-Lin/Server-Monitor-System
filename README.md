# Server-Monitor-System

This project primarily uses OpenSSH to communicate and interact with a group of internal network servers. It executes CMD commands through Python to retrieve information such as CPU, memory, C drive, user accounts, and user IPs from all servers. The retrieved information is then stored in a MySQL database.
